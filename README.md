# Rain Alarm Android

## Name
Rain Alarm

## Description
Rain Alarm is, as its name suggests, alarms the user when it will rain shortly in the future. 

## Visuals
Soon..

## Installation
Just install the APK and you're good to go!

## Usage
Just open the app, locate yourself and the app will do all the work.

- The periodicity of the rain check is set to **3 hours**. Note that this is just an **estimate** (a minimum) since your device will execute the check only when certain conditions are met. 
For example: You won't recieve any notifications if your phone is in **doze mode** (Left idle for a certain duration)
- You will only recieve alerts if it will rain from 7:00 to 22:00.

## Issues
In some devices, the alerts system may not work as expected due to OS level background restrictions.

- If you don't recieve any alerts after closing the app, **make sure you didn't close it from the recent apps tray**. Some OS identify this as an intention to **force stop** the app, which is not the normal behavior recommended by Android.
- If you don't recieve any alerts after restarting your phone, you can try to give the app the permission to auto start. This is usually found on the app info settings.

## Support
Soon..

## Roadmap
- Add notification preferences
- Add location search by name
- Optimize notifications and make them more customizable
